# TransForeCaster: In-and-cross categorized feature integration in user-centric deep representation learning

2-stage process: In-Category Integration (ICI) and Cross-Category Integration (CCI).

ICI employs a Time-Series Feature Mixer (TSFM) based on 1D-CNN, VAE structure.

CCI employs a Meta-Conditioned Transformer (MCT) based on Transformer architecture.
